# New Client

The `NewClient(tlsConfig *tls.Config, logger *zerolog.Logger) (*Client, error){:go}` method is used to create a new fRPC client.

It takes two arguments:
- `tlsConfig{:.keyword}`: a `*tls.Config{:go}` that will be used to configure TLS for the underlying connection. This can be left as `nil{:go}` if no TLS is required.
- `logger{:.keyword}`: a `*zerolog.Logger{:go}` that will be used to log all events. This can be left as `nil{:go}` if no logging is required.

It returns an fRPC `*Client{:go}` on success and an error otherwise.

# Generated Methods

When generating the fRPC Client, each service in the `.proto{:.keyword}` file also results in a generated `service{:.keyword}` Client.
Then, for each RPC in the service, a method is generated on the appropriate the `service{:.keyword}` client.
For example, if the `.proto{:.keyword}` file contains the following service definition:

```proto
service MyService {
  rpc MyMethod(MyRequest) returns (MyResponse) {}
}
```

then the generated `service{:.keyword}` Client method is:
```go
func (c *MyService) MyMethod(ctx context.Context, req *MyRequest) (res *MyResponse, err error) {
  ...
}
```

and it's meant to be invoked using:
```go
res, err := c.MyService.MyMethod(ctx, req)
```

Unlike gRPC, where each service requires creating a new RPC Client, fRPC creates a single client for all your services.

# Connect

The `client.Connect(addr string){:go}` method is used to initiate a connection to an fRPC server.
If a `*tls.Config{:go}` was provided when the client was created (using `NewClient{:.keyword}`)
it will be used to configure TLS for the connection.
