# Generated Interfaces

When generating the fRPC Server, each service in the `.proto{:.keyword}` file requires a `service implementation{:.keyword}` that
fulfills the RPC methods defined for the service.

For example, if the `.proto{:.keyword}` file contains the following service definition:
```proto
service MyService {
  rpc MyMethod(MyRequest) returns (MyResponse) {}
}
```

then the generated `service implementation {:.keyword}` interface looks like this:
```go
type MyService interface {
	MyMethod(context.Context, *MyRequest) (*MyResponse, error)
}
```

This is a similar function signature to the one gRPC would generate, making it easy to reuse the service implementation from gRPC.
