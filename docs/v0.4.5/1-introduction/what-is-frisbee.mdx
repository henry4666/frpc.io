title: What Is Frisbee?

Frisbee is best described as a <CH.InlineCode>bring-your-own-protocol</CH.InlineCode> messaging framework. Our goal was
to make it possible for Developers to define their **own** messaging patterns and protocols, and have the actual
lower-level implementations done for them by the library.

# Why is Frisbee Necessary?

Messaging frameworks in general have been around for years, and as distributed systems become the norm, it's more and
more important to have efficient, reliable communication protocols.

Well-defined protocols like [NATS](https://nats.io) or [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) are good at what they do,
however they are designed for very specific use cases, are difficult to embed, and in general aren't very flexible.

Systems like [GRPC](https://grpc.io) on the other hand are supposed to provide more flexibility by allowing developers
to specify message types and handlers on the server-side, however the overhead of GRPC and the requirement of Protocol
Buffers adds unnecessary bloat to applications - not to mention that only the Request/Reply pattern is supported.

[Frisbee](https://github.com/loopholelabs/frisbee), on the other hand allows Developers to implement any messaging
pattern they choose - whether that's PUB/SUB, or Request/Reply or something completely custom. Frisbee is also
significantly more flexible than protocols like GRPC or NATS because it was not designed for just a single use-case,
and instead provides building blocks that can be used to build protocols on top of.

As an example, we wanted to create a simple PUB/SUB application using Frisbee that would perform on-par (or better) than
NATS in an apples-to-apples comparison. The resulting [repository](https://github.com/loopholelabs/frisbee-benchmarks/tree/master/nats-benchmark/frisbee)
is only **300 lines of code** and [out-performs NATS in a real-world test by 10%]().

# Frisbee RPC

While implementing and using Frisbee at [Loophole Labs](https://loopholelabs.io), our team realized that we needed
the ability to

ability to define message types in a standardized [proto3](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3)
format and then have the accompanying Frisbee code generated for us
