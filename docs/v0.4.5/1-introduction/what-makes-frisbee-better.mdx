title: What Makes Frisbee Better?
order: 1

With **Zero Allocations** in the hot-path and an 8-Byte Packet Header, the network overhead of Frisbee is significantly
lower than that of existing protocols like GRPC (performance comparisons available in our [Performance Section](https://frisbee.sh/performance/introduction)).

This makes it feasible to use Frisbee (and [Frisbee RPC]()) for real-time streaming applications or in data-heavy pipelines.

One of the most exciting features in Frisbee is the ability to **turn Frisbee off** whenever you like. This means it's
possible to establish a Frisbee connection, stream some data (or use RPCs), and then turn Frisbee off and retrieve a
complete normal TCP socket with zero overhead.

This opens up a world of interesting messaging patterns - like authenticating a connection using Frisbee RPC then turning
Frisbee off and using the resulting TCP socket to proxy HTTP traffic.
