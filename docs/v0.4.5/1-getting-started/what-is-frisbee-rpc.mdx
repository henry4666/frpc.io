title: What Is Frisbee RPC?
order: 1
---

Before we built Frisbee, our team at [Loophole Labs](https://loopholelabs.io) was evaluating GRPC for use in our backend.
We loved the idea of defining our message types in a standardized [proto3](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3)
format and having the [protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) compiler generate all the necessary
glue code for us.

What we didn't like was the [overhead](https://github.com/boguslaw-wojcik/encoding-benchmarks) of encoding and decoding
messages in the Protobuf format, and wanted something light-weight and much more flexible.

As a result, we ended up building [Frisbee RPC](). By making use of protobuf plugins, Frisbee RPC allows developers to
use their existing proto3 files to generate a full RPC Framework that uses Frisbee under the hood.

Moreover, Frisbee is a **drop-in replacement for GRPC** thanks to our generated interfaces matching GRPC's, and in an
apples-to-apples comparison, [Frisbee RPC blows GRPC's performance out of the water]().
